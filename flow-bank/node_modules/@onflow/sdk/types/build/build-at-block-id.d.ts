/**
 * A builder function that returns a partial interaction to a block at a specific block ID.
 *
 * Use with other interactions like 'fcl.getBlock()' to get a full interaction at the specified block ID.
 *
 * Block ID is SHA3-256 hash of the entire block payload. This hash is stored as an ID field on any block response object (ie. response from 'GetLatestBlock').
 *
 * @param id The ID of the block to execute the interaction at
 * @returns A partial interaction to be paired with another interaction such as 'fcl.getBlock()' or 'fcl.getAccount()'
 *
 * @example
 * import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl";
 *
 * // Get block by ID
 * await fcl.send([fcl.getBlock(), fcl.atBlockId("23232323232")]).then(fcl.decode);
 *
 * // Get account at specific block ID
 * await fcl.send([
 *   fcl.getAccount("0x1d007d755706c469"),
 *   fcl.atBlockId("9dda5f281897389b99f103a1c6b180eec9dac870de846449a302103ce38453f3")
 * ]).then(fcl.decode);
 *
 * // Execute script at specific block
 * await fcl.send([
 *   fcl.script`
 *     access(all) fun main(): UFix64 {
 *       return getCurrentBlock().timestamp
 *     }
 *   `,
 *   fcl.atBlockId("a1b2c3d4e5f6")
 * ]).then(fcl.decode);
