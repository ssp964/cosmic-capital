/**
 * @description Checks if WalletConnect service plugin is enabled and logs a warning if it's not.
 * This function verifies that the WalletConnect strategy is registered in the service registry.
 * It's called internally by FCL to notify developers about missing WalletConnect configuration,
 * which is required for users to connect with certain wallets.
 *
 * @example
 * // This function is called automatically by FCL, but can be used manually:
 * checkWalletConnectEnabled()
 * // If WalletConnect is not configured, an error will be logged to the console
 *
 * // To properly configure WalletConnect to avoid the warning:
 * import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"
 *
 * fcl.config({
 *   "app.detail.title": "My App",
 *   "walletconnect.projectId": "your-walletconnect-project-id"
 * })
